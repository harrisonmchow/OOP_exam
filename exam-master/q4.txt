Issues you may face with this appraoch include the reliance of one system on another. For example, to complete the exercises, we must first log into Confluence, and then log into GitLab. Hence, the exercises require that both services must be working at the same time. Additionally, we'd have to have both browsers open to look at the code, and the spec at the same time. In terms of software design, this can be viewed as a lack of cohesion. Both gitlab and the spec are directly linked and should work together as a singular module, yet they are split up which creates unneeded trouble. Additionally, Confluence requiring Gitlab to work to complete the exercise can be seen as coupling. If we were to instead have everything in one location, issues would be minimised.
