A design pattern which could be used to model this system is the push iteration of the Observer pattern. In this case, each ticket (linked to a certain project) has a list of subscribers, which are the stakeholders who are interested for each project. Each subscriber has a list of subjects that they are subscribed to (the projects that each stakeholder is intereseted in). In this case, the Ticket is the subject, and the list of stake holders is the observers (or subscribers). Then, when the update is posted, all subscribers of the ticket are notified. Since the subject pushes notifications to its subscribers, it is a push version of the Observer pattern. ÃŸ
